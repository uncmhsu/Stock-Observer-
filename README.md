Stock Observer - A program to practice using the Java Observer Design Pattern

Used the Java Observer/Observable Design Pattern to create a Stock Observer program that displays the price of stocks.

I also added in threading to simulate the display of stock prices in real-time.

My next goal for this project is to actually display the live prices of real stocks in real-time so that this program can become a useful tool, and to create a search tool for the user to search for stocks.
